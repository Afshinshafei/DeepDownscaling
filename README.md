# DeepDownscaling
### Deep learning approaches for statistical downscaling in climate

Transparency and reproducibility are key ingredients to develop top-quality science. For this reason, this repository is aimed at hosting and maintaining updated versions of the code needed to (partly or fully) reproduce the results presented in the [Santander Met Group](http://www.meteo.unican.es/en/view/publications) papers dealing with the application of deep learning techniques for statistical dowscaling in climate.

We lean for many tasks on [climate4R](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R), a bundle of `R` packages developed by the Santander Met Group for transparent climate data access, post processing (including bias correction and downscaling), visualization and model validation. A battery of Jupyter notebooks with worked examples explaining how to use the main functionalities of the core climate4R packages (including [downscaleR](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/downscaleR) for standard statistical downscaling methods) can be found [here](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/notebooks).
For deep learning impplementations we use [`keras`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/keras/index.html), an `R` library which provides an interface to [Keras](https://keras.io), a high-level neural networks API which supports arbitrary network architectures and is seamlessly integrated with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

The table below lists the documents (Jupyter notebooks, scripts, etc.) contained in this respository along with the information of the corresponding published (or submitted) papers.
