# DeepDownscaling
Deep learning methods in statistical downscaling for climate change research

Downscaling is a methodology widely used to bridge the gap between the coarse resolution of Global Climate Models (GCMs) and the local scale. In this decade, deep learning has recently landed in the downscaling scene ([Vandal,2017](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3100000/3098004/p1663-vandal.pdf?ip=193.144.210.92&id=3098004&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=DD1EC5BCF38B3699%2E7E2EC88036375C9D%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1568215237_3e6de1805cae418d3adc967d411aeb3a)),([Rodrigues,2018](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8588749)) showing promising results to reproduce the local variability of climate variables. In particular, convolutional neural networks ([LeCun,1995](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yann_Lecun/publication/2453996_Convolutional_Networks_for_Images_Speech_and_Time-Series/links/0deec519dfa2325502000000.pdf)) stood out over benchmark methods in the largest-to-date downscaling intercomparison study ([author,year]), which is framed under the european cost-action VALUE ([Guti√©rrez,2018](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/joc.5462)). In order to provide the impact and mitigation communities with reliable high-resoluted climate change projections, it is especially relevant to evaluate how downscaling tools would perform under these scenarios, where extrapolation capabilities are expected. A simple analysis involving the extrapolation abilities of deep learning ended up with succesfull results for both downscaling of precipitation and temperature ([author,year]). However, a more detailed analysis regarding the performance of downscaling methods (including deep learning) under the framework of the VALUE intercomparison project was carried out ([author,year]), suggesting that convolutional models maintain stable while working on future climate conditions.

The concern about reproducibility keeps growing due to its importance to develop top quality science. Therefore, the main objective of this repository is to maintain the companion notebooks related to the applications of deep learning in downscaling presented in several journal papers by the [Santander Meteorology Group (SMG)](http://www.meteo.unican.es/en/view/publications). The notebooks contain all the required information regarding the loading, processing, downscaling, visualization and validation of the results. The latter working steps mainly rely on the [climate4R] http://www.meteo.unican.es/climate4R packages: loadeR, transformeR, downscaleR, visualizeR, climate4R.value. A more detailed and comprehensive description of these libraries can be found in the [climate4R repository](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/notebooks) , which contains illustrative notebooks explaining the functioning of its packages. On the other hand, the construction of deep learning topologies in the below notebooks rely on the R version of the Keras library, which is especially devoted to tasks related to deep learning.

The table below resumes the notebooks contained in this respository along with information of the respective published (or on going) journal articles.
