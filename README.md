Deep learning methods in statistical downscaling for climate change research

Downscaling is a methodology widely used to bridge the gap between the coarse resolution of Global Climate Models (GCMs) and the local scale, providing high-resoluted climate information. In order to assess, it is especially relevant to evaluate how downscaling tools would perform under climate change scenarios, where extrapolation capabilities are expected. In this decade, deep learning has recently landed in the downscaling scene ([author,year]),([author,year]) showing promising results to reproduce the local variability of climate variables. In particular, convolutional neural networks ([author,year]) stood out over benchmark methods in the largest-to-date downscaling intercomparison study ([author,year]), which is framed under the european cost-action VALUE ([author,year]). Moreover, ([author,year]) elaborated a simple analysis involving the extrapolation abilities of deep learning, crucial in climate change research, with succesfull results for both downscaling of precipitation and temperature. However, a more detailed analysis regarding the performance of downscaling methods (including deep learning) under the framework of the VALUE intercomparison project was carried out ([author,year]), suggesting that

In order to keep, the concern about reproducibility The main objective of this repository is to maintain the companion notebooks related to the applications of deep learning in downscaling presented in several journal papers by the Santander Meteorology Group (SMG). ..R software and climate4R and keras (links para mas detalles)
