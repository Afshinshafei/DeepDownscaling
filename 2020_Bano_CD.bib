abstract = "Within the FP7 EUPORIAS project we have assessed the utility of dynamical and statistical downscaling to provide seasonal forecast for impact modelling in eastern Africa. An ensemble of seasonal hindcasts was generated by the global climate model (GCM) EC-EARTH and then downscaled by four regional climate models and by two statistical methods over eastern Africa with focus on Ethiopia. The five-month hindcast includes 15 members, initialised on May 1 st covering 1991–2012. There are two sub-regions where the global hindcast has some skill in predicting June–September rainfall (northern Ethiopia – northeast Sudan and southern Sudan - northern Uganda). The regional models are able to reproduce the predictive signal evident in the driving EC-EARTH hindcast over Ethiopia in June–September showing about the same performance as their driving GCM. Statistical downscaling, in general, loses a part of the EC-EARTH signal at grid box scale but shows some improvement after spatial aggregation. At the same time there are no clear evidences that the dynamical and statistical downscaling provide added value compared to the driving EC-EARTH if we define the added value as a higher forecast skill in the downscaled hindcast, although there is a tendency of improved reliability through the downscaling. The use of the global and downscaled hindcasts as input for the Livelihoods, Early Assessment and Protection (LEAP) platform of the World Food Programme in Ethiopia shows that the performance of the LEAP platform in predicting humanitarian needs at the national and sub-national levels is not improved by using downscaled seasonal forecasts."

        abstract = {The Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) provides an unprecedented opportunity
to comprehensively explore biases and changes in storm tracks across all seasons using
storm-centered feature tracking methods. 29 CMIP5 models in fully-coupled and atmosphereonly
configurations are compared to a reanalysis to assess biases, and two Radiative Concentration
Pathways simulations are contrasted against the present-day climate to assess future
projections.
The models are found to have a pervasive equatorward bias in storm track position, and
a zonal bias in their tilt. The primary cyclogenesis and storm growth regions have severe
negative biases, contributing to an overall lack in the simulated total number of storms. The
models generally under-represent the extratropical cyclone intensity, in part related to low
spatial resolution. A particularly novel result is that the coupling with ocean and sea-ice components
often contributes to the equatorward bias in the storm tracks, but is found to reduce
the negative cyclogenesis biases and produce more storms. Many of the storm track biases are
associated with equatorward and slow jet biases, and temperature biases.
In general, the future projections show a small poleward shift in the storm tracks and a
slight contraction in their width, which are strongly associated with changes in the mean flow.
This work has given several new insights, for example in demonstrating the robustness of
the equatorward decreases in the storm tracks across the seasons. Exceptions to this include
the North Atlantic in the winter and spring; and the North Pacific in summer, with the latter
example having large uncertainty associated with uniquely large biases. There is a global,
year-round decrease in the total number of storms. Cyclone intensity distributions are generally
projected to shift slightly towards stronger storms in the Southern Hemisphere while
there are few changes in the Northern Hemisphere}

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper describes the third full release of the Rossby Centre Regional Climate model (RCA3), with an emphasis on changes compared to earlier versions, in particular the introduction of a new tiled land-surface scheme. The model performance over Europe when driven at the boundaries by ERA40 reanalysis is discussed and systematic biases identified. This discussion is performed for key near-surface variables, such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed and snow amounts at both seasonal and daily timescales. An analysis of simulated clouds and surface turbulent and radiation fluxes is also made, to understand the causes of the identified biases. RCA3 shows equally good, or better, correspondence to observations than previous model versions at both analysed timescales. The primary model bias relates to an underestimate of the diurnal surface temperature range over Northern Europe, which maximizes in summer. This error is mainly linked to an overestimate of soil heat flux. It is shown that the introduction of an organic soil component reduces the error significantly. During the summer season, precipitation and surface evaporation are both overestimated over Northern Europe, whereas for most other regions and seasons precipitation and surface turbulent fluxes are well simulated.},

To this end, in addition to standard accuracy measures and distributional similarity scores, the authors estimate the robustness of the methods under warming climate conditions working with anomalous warm historical periods. This validation framework is applied to intercompare the performances of 12 different SD methods (from the analog, weather typing, and regression families) for downscaling minimum and maximum temperatures in Spain. First, a calibration of these methods is performed in terms of both geographical domains and predictor sets; the results are highly dependent on the latter, with optimum predictor sets including near-surface temperature data (in particular 2-m temperature), which appropriately discriminate cold episodes related to temperature inversion in the lower troposphere.Although regression methods perform best in terms of correlation, analog and weather generator approaches are more appropriate for reproducing the observed distributions, especially in case of wintertime minimum temperature. However, the latter two families significantly underestimate the temperature anomalies of the warm periods considered in this work. This underestimation is found to be critical when considering the warming signal in the late twenty-first century as given by a global climate model [the ECHAM5âMax Planck Institute (MPI) model]. In this case, the different downscaling methods provide warming values with differences in the range of 1Â°C, in agreement with the robustness significance values. Therefore, the proposed test is a promising technique for detecting lack of robustness in statistical downscaling methods applied in climate change studies.},

Whereas the companion paper focused on temperatures, the present manuscript deals with precipitation and considers an ensemble of 12 SDMs from the analog, weather typing, and regression families. First, the performance of the methods is cross-validated considering reanalysis predictors, screening different geographical domains and predictor sets. Standard accuracy and distributional similarity scores and a test for extrapolation capability are considered. The results are highly dependent on the predictor sets, with optimum configurations including information from midtropospheric humidity. Second, a reduced ensemble of well-performing SDMs is applied to four GCMs to properly assess the uncertainty of downscaled future climate projections. The results are compared with an ensemble of regional climate models (RCMs) produced in the ENSEMBLES project. Generally, the mean signal is similar with both methodologies (with the exception of summer, which is drier for the RCMs) but the uncertainty (spread) is larger for the SDM ensemble. Finally, the spread contribution of the GCM- and SDM-derived components is assessed using a simple analysis of variance previously applied to the RCMs, obtaining larger interaction terms. Results show that the main contributor to the spread is the choice of the GCM, although the SDM dominates the uncertainty in some cases during autumn and summer due to the diverging projections from different families.},

An ensemble of seasonal hindcasts was generated by the global climate model (GCM) EC-EARTH and then downscaled by four regional climate models and by two statistical methods over eastern Africa with focus on Ethiopia. The five-month hindcast includes 15 members, initialised on May 1â¯st covering 1991â2012. There are two sub-regions where the global hindcast has some skill in predicting JuneâSeptember rainfall (northern Ethiopia â northeast Sudan and southern Sudan - northern Uganda). The regional models are able to reproduce the predictive signal evident in the driving EC-EARTH hindcast over Ethiopia in JuneâSeptember showing about the same performance as their driving GCM. Statistical downscaling, in general, loses a part of the EC-EARTH signal at grid box scale but shows some improvement after spatial aggregation. At the same time there are no clear evidences that the dynamical and statistical downscaling provide added value compared to the driving EC-EARTH if we define the added value as a higher forecast skill in the downscaled hindcast, although there is a tendency of improved reliability through the downscaling. The use of the global and downscaled hindcasts as input for the Livelihoods, Early Assessment and Protection (LEAP) platform of the World Food Programme in Ethiopia shows that the performance of the LEAP platform in predicting humanitarian needs at the national and sub-national levels is not improved by using downscaled seasonal forecasts."

To this aim, a generalized linear model (GLM) approach is applied to downscale daily precipitation in the Philippines. First, the GLMs are trained and tested separately with two distinct reanalyses (ERA-Interim and JRA-25) using a cross-validation scheme over the period 1981?2000. When the observed and downscaled time series are compared, the attained performance is found to be sensitive to the reanalysis considered if climate change signal?bearing variables (temperature and/or specific humidity) are included in the predictor field. Moreover, performance differences are shown to be in correspondence with the disagreement found between the raw predictors from the two reanalyses. Second, the regression coefficients calibrated either with ERA-Interim or JRA-25 are subsequently applied to the output of a global climate model (MPI-ECHAM5) in order to assess the sensitivity of local-scale climate change projections (up to 2100) to reanalysis choice. In this case, the differences detected in present climate conditions are considerably amplified, leading to ?delta-change? estimates differing by up to 35\% (on average for the entire country) depending on the reanalysis used for calibration. Therefore, reanalysis choice is an important contributor to the uncertainty of local-scale climate change projections and, consequently, should be treated with as much care as other better-known sources of uncertainty (e.g., the choice of the GCM and/or downscaling method). Implications of the results for the entire tropics, as well as for the model output statistics downscaling approach are also briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Summary
The Climate impact studies in hydrology often rely on climate change information at fine spatial resolution. However, general circulation models (GCMs), which are among the most advanced tools for estimating future climate change scenarios, operate on a coarse scale. Therefore the output from a GCM has to be downscaled to obtain the information relevant to hydrologic studies. In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) approach is proposed for statistical downscaling of precipitation at monthly time scale. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through its application to meteorological sub-divisions (MSDs) in India. First, climate variables affecting spatio-temporal variation of precipitation at each MSD in India are identified. Following this, the data pertaining to the identified climate variables (predictors) at each MSD are classified using cluster analysis to form two groups, representing wet and dry seasons. For each MSD, SVM- based downscaling model (DM) is developed for season(s) with significant rainfall using principal components extracted from the predictors as input and the contemporaneous precipitation observed at the MSD as an output. The proposed DM is shown to be superior to conventional downscaling using multi-layer back-propagation artificial neural networks. Subsequently, the SVM-based DM is applied to future climate predictions from the second generation Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM2) to obtain future projections of precipitation for the MSDs. The results are then analyzed to assess the impact of climate change on precipitation over India. It is shown that SVMs provide a promising alternative to conventional artificial neural networks for statistical downscaling, and are suitable for conducting climate impact studies.},

This version provides an improved estimation of interpolation uncertainty through the calculation of a 100-member ensemble of realizations of each daily field. The data set covers the period back to 1950 and provides gridded fields at a spacing of 0.25? ? 0.25? in regular latitude/longitude coordinates. As with the original E-OBS data set, the ensemble version is based on the station series collated as part of the ECA\&D initiative. Station density varies significantly over the domain, and over time, and a reliable estimation of interpolation uncertainty in the gridded fields is therefore important for users of the data set. The uncertainty quantified by the ensemble data set is more realistic than the uncertainty estimates in the original version, although uncertainty is still underestimated in data-sparse regions. The new data set is compared against the earlier version of E-OBS and against regional gridded data sets produced by a selection of National Meteorological Services. In terms of both climatological averages and extreme values, the new version of E-OBS is broadly comparable to the earlier version. Nonetheless, users will notice differences between the two E-OBS versions, especially for precipitation, which arises from the different gridding method used.},

Agriculture, transportation, and energy are sectors that depend on high-resolution weather models, which typically consume many hours of large High Performance Computing (HPC) systems to deliver timely results. Many users cannot afford to run the desired resolution and are forced to use low resolution output. One simple solution is to interpolate results for visualization. It is also possible to combine an ensemble of low resolution models to obtain a better prediction. However, these approaches fail to capture the redundant information and patterns in the low-resolution input that could help improve the quality of prediction. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a strategy based on a deep neural network to learn a high-resolution representation from low-resolution predictions using weather forecast as a practical use case. We take a supervised learning approach, since obtaining labeled data can be done automatically. Our results show significant improvement when compared with standard practices and the strategy is still lightweight enough to run on modest computer systems.},

	abstract = {Statistical downscaling of Global Climate Models (GCMs) allows researchers to study local climate change effects decades into the future. A wide range of statistical models have been applied to downscaling GCMs but recent advances in machine learning have not been explored compared to traditional approaches. In this paper, we compare five Perfect Prognosis (PP) approaches, Ordinary Least Squares, Elastic-Net, and Support Vector Machine along with two machine learning methods Multi-task Sparse Structure Learning (MSSL) and Autoencoder Neural Networks. In addition, we introduce a hybrid Model Output Statistics and PP approach by modeling the residuals of Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) with MSSL. Metrics to evaluate each methodâs ability to capture daily anomalies, large-scale climate shifts, and extremes are analyzed. Generally, we find inconsistent performance between PP methods in their ability to predict daily anomalies and extremes as well as monthly and annual precipitation. However, results suggest that L1 sparsity constraints aid in reducing error through internal feature selection. The MSSL+BCSD coupling, when compared with BCSD, improved daily, monthly, and annual predictability but decreased performance at the extremes. Hence, these results suggest that the direct application of state-ofthe-art machine learning methods to statistical downscaling does not provide direct improvements over simpler, longstanding approaches.},

	abstract = {Precipitation process is generally considered to be poorly represented in numerical weather/climate models. Statistical downscaling (SD) methods, which relate precipitation with model resolved dynamics, often provide more accurate precipitation estimates compared to model's raw precipitation products. We introduce the convolutional neural network model to foster this aspect of SD for daily precipitation prediction. Specifically, we restrict the predictors to the variables that are directly resolved by discretizing the atmospheric dynamics equations. In this sense, our model works as an alternative to the existing precipitation-related parameterization schemes for numerical precipitation estimation. We train the model to learn precipitation-related dynamical features from the surrounding dynamical fields by optimizing a hierarchical set of spatial convolution kernels. We test the model at 14 geogrid points across the contiguous United States. Results show that provided with enough data, precipitation estimates from the convolutional neural network model outperform the reanalysis precipitation products, as well as SD products using linear regression, nearest neighbor, random forest, or fully connected deep neural network. Evaluation for the test set suggests that the improvements can be seamlessly transferred to numerical weather modeling for improving precipitation prediction. Based on the default network, we examine the impact of the network architectures on model performance. Also, we offer simple visualization and analyzing approaches to interpret the models and their results. Our study contributes to the following two aspects: First, we offer a novel approach to enhance numerical precipitation estimation; second, the proposed model provides important implications for improving precipitation-related parameterization schemes using a data-driven approach.},

The capability of proposed hybrid model was verified by downscaling daily rainfall at three rain-gauge locations in the east cost of peninsular Malaysia. Obtained results reveal that the hybrid model can downscale rainfall with Nash-Sutcliff efficiency in the range of 0.90-0.93, which is much higher compared to RF and SVM downscaling models. The hybrid model was also found to replicate the variability, number of consecutive wet days, 95-percentile rainfall amount in each months as well as distribution of observed rainfall reliably.},

This study provides a general comparison between uncertainties in downscaled results from three commonly used predictor selection methods (correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, and stepwise regression analysis). Uncertainty is analyzed by comparing statistical indices, including the mean, variance, and the distribution of monthly mean daily precipitation, wet spell length, and the number of wet days. The downscaled results are produced by the artificial neural network (ANN) statistical downscaling model and 50 years (1961â2010) of observed daily precipitation together with reanalysis predictors. Although results show little difference between downscaling methods, stepwise regression analysis is generally the best method for selecting predictors for the ANN statistical downscaling model of daily precipitation, followed by partial correlation analysis and then correlation analysis.},

	abstract = {The increasing demand for high-resolution climate information has attracted a growing attention for statistical downscaling methods (SD), due in part to their relative advantages and merits as compared to dynamical approaches (based on regional climate model simulations), such as their much lower computational cost and their ï¬tness-for-purpose for many localscale applications. As a result, a plethora of SD methods is nowadays available for climate scientists, which has motivated 5 recent efforts for their comprehensive evaluation, like the VALUE Project (http://www.value-cost.eu). The systematic intercomparison of a large number of SD techniques undertaken in VALUE, many of them independently developed by different authors and modeling centers in a variety of languages/environments, has shown a compelling need for new tools allowing for their application within an integrated framework. With this regard, downscaleR is an R package for statistical downscaling of climate information which covers the most popular approaches (Model Output Statistics âincluding the so called 10 âbias correctionâ methodsâ and Perfect Prognosis) and state-of-the-art techniques. It has been conceived to work primarily with daily data and can be used in the framework of both seasonal forecasting and climate change studies. Its full integration within the climate4R framework (Iturbide et al., 2019) makes possible the development of end-to-end downscaling applications, from data retrieval to model building, validation and prediction, bringing to climate scientists and practitioners a unique comprehensive framework for SD model development.},

	abstract = {Statistical downscaling models (SDMs) and bias correction (BC) methods are commonly used to provide regional or debiased climate projections. However, most SDMs are utilized in a âperfect prognosisâ context, meaning that they are calibrated on reanalysis predictors before being applied to GCM simulations. If the latter are biased, SDMs might suffer from discrepancies with observations and therefore provide unrealistic projections. It is then necessary to study the influence of applying bias correcting to large-scale predictors for SDMs, since it can have impacts on the local-scale simulations: such an investigation for daily temperature and precipitation is the goal of this study. Hence, four temperature and three precipitation SDMs are calibrated over a historical period. First, the SDMs are forced by historical predictors from two GCMs, corrected or not corrected. The two types of simulations are compared with reanalysis-driven SDM outputs to characterize the quality of the simulations. Second, changes in basic statistical properties of the raw GCM projections and those of the SDM simulationsâdriven by bias-corrected or raw predictors from GCM future projectionsâare compared. Third, the stationarity of the SDM changes brought by the BC of the predictors is investigated. Changes are computed over a historical (1976â2005) and future (2071â2100) time period and compared to assess the nonstationarity. Overall, BC can have impacts on the SDM simulations, although its influence varies from one SDM to another and from one GCM to another, with different spatial structures, and depends on the considered statistical properties. Nevertheless, corrected predictors generally improve the historical projections and can impact future evolutions with potentially strong nonstationary behaviors.},

With foreknowledge of the state of ENSO, stakeholders can anticipate and mitigate impacts in climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture and energy. Traditionally, ENSO forecasts have been produced using either computationally intensive physics-based dynamical models or statistical models that make limiting assumptions, such as linearity between predictors and predictands. Here we present a deep-learning-based methodology for forecasting monthly ENSO temperatures at various lead times. While traditional statistical methods both train and validate on observational data, our method trains exclusively on physical simulations. With the entire observational record as an out-of-sample validation set, the methodâs skill is comparable to that of operational dynamical models. The method is also used to identify disagreements among climate models about the predictability of ENSO in a world with climate change.},

This paper presents a synthesis of the VALUE special issue, with a focus on the results of this first experiment. This paper presents a synthesis of the results. Model output statistics performs mostly well, but requires predictors at a resolution close to the target one. Perfect prog performance depends crucially on model structure and predictor choice. Weather generators perform in principle well for all aspects that can be expressed by the available model structure. Inter-annual variability is underrepresented by both perfect prog and weather generator approaches. Spatial variability is poorly represented by almost all participating methods (inherited by model output statistics from the driving model, not represented by the perfect prog and weather generator methods). Further studies are required to systematically assess (a) the role of predictor choice for perfect prog; (b) the performance of spatial weather generators, to study the performance based on GCM predictors; (c) downscaling skill in simulated future climates; and (d) the credibility of simulated predictors in a future climate.},
